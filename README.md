# Project Atlas

Project Atlas is born with the idea to substiute the codebase for my previous web based mockup creator [pinocchio](http://pinocchio.us).

The new architecture of the project is base on React/Redux to increase severely the performance, which is the main flaw of pinocchio being an AngularJS app.

This kind of application is hevily dependant on modifying the DOM to make drawings of wireframe and hi-fi mockups, therefore, AngularJS was not the best tool to achieve the goal.

Needless to say Atlas is currently on a very early stage.

There's a big reason for an open source project like Atlas, and it is that there are several apps nowadays that achieve the same purpose and even a few that are built on web tecnologies as well. None of them are Open Source, so it can be a good idea to build such a program to have an alternative which you can fork and tailor to your needs.

If you share the passion for web technologies and find that prototyping software is missing an open alternative you are more than welcome to participate.

## Notes

This project was bootstraped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), thus it responds to all of it's commands.
